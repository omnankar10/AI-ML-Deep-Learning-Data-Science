# Building an Image Classification project with CIFAR 10 Dataset

A project review

## Tools used
* Python (3.7)
* Anaconda -> Jupyter
* Tensorflow 
* Keras

## Installation
[CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is the dataset used for the project.
Use the package [pip](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) to install Tensorflow.


## Tasks for loading the data set and creating the model
**Imports needed**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```
---
**Models used**
Core as well as Convulational Models of Keras were used 
```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, BatchNormalization
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dropout, Flatten, Input, Dense
```
